# FloppaMods
This is mainly a repository for scripts I actually make, instead of just yoinking them off of scriptblox, rscripts or the synapse x discord.
Currently the only one I have made is in legendary-train, and I'm not moving it. Don't expect anything too good from here, I'm mainly doing this to learn lua better.
